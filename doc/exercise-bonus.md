# Exercise 18: Assert deletion

## Description
1. Extend the `ContactRestClient` by adding a new method: `getContacts(int page, int size)`
Note: `page` and `size` are query params

2. Create multiple contacts

3. Retrieve multiple contacts by page using query params `page` and `size`

4. Paginate through the contacts (make sure you have at least 2 or 3 pages you navigate through)

5. Assert the result of each page

6. EXTRA: Assert that you do not see any other contacts AFTER your last page
