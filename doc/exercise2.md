# Exercise 2: Create operation (extended)

## Description exercise
Improve the existing test scenarios (from previous exercise)

1. Create a Contact POJO and use this to create objects to POST contacts. Also, create a POJO for the error response body in case of error situations.

2. Assert the result for each test with the same objects.

Note: in error scenarios: assert error response and check that the Contact is actually not created.
